                            <h3>Springer Mountain</h3>
                            <p>I decided to hike the Appalachian Trial some years ago. I started at Springer Mountain in Georgia.</p>

                            <h3>Clingmans Dome</h3>
                            <p>After hiking 76 miles through Georgia and crossing into Tennessee I came across Clingmans Dome Observation Tower.</p>

                            <h3>Bald Mountains</h3>
                            <p>I eventually passed over the peak of Bald Mountains and met some great people along the way!</p>

                            <h3>A random Church</h3>
                            <p>It was cloudy, cold, and wet, I was tired and exhausted thinking "why am I doing this" when I noticed the sun shining out of the corner of my eye, to my surprise it was shining directly on a church in the middle of nowhere. I'm not very religious but this lifted my spirits and I took it as a sign to keep on going. "I can do this!" I thought to myself.</p>

                            <h3>Some other good views</h3>
                            <p>Some mornings you would wake up to a beautiful sunrise over a lake and other mornings you would wake up to a soaking wet sleeping bag covered in snow. It was a fun time and I would do it again.</p>
